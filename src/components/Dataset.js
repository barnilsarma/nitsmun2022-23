The resolution proclaiming the Day was presented by the State of Qatar and was supported by 62 countries.<br/><br/> The General Assembly resolution states that countries have the primary responsibility to provide protection and ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels to all learners (in the 3-18years age group), especially those in vulnerable situations.<br/><br/> This year NITSMUN takes pride and the opportunity to raise awareness and show the importance, effectiveness and impact of providing access to quality educational opportunities for all in times of crisis.</>),

In this chaos, the voices of the victims are often left unheard, their rights being forgotten, their needs remaining unattended and their values lost forever.<br/><br/> Most of the victims of terrorism are innocent civilians, in the wrong place at the wrong time, targeted by brutal and indiscriminate attacks. The lives of survivors of the attacks and the families of the victims are irreparably damaged. It takes many survivors years, and some never recover from these traumatic memories.<br/><br/> For this reason, the United Nations General Assembly established the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism to be commemorated annually on 21 August since 2017, in order to fully honour and support the victims and survivors of terrorism and to promote and protect the full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.<br/><br/> We cannot have a war on terrorism when war itself is terrorism.

More people than ever before need humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/> There is a saying that goes: It takes a village to raise a child. Similarly, it takes many people to support a person in a humanitarian crisis. With the world reaching the zenith of humanitarian needs, this year’s World Humanitarian Day (WHD) builds on this metaphor of collective endeavor to grow global appreciation of humanitarian work.<br/><br/> On 19 August 2003, a bomb attack in Baghdad, Iraq, killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq. Five years after that terrible mishap, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day (WHD).<br/><br/> Far from any spotlight , some God-like  souls come together to ease suffering and bring optimism.The 2022 WHD campaign pays a heed to the thousands of volunteers and professionals  who deliver urgent health care, shelter, food, protection, water and much more.<br/><br/> Each year, WHD brings together countries from across the humanitarian system to stand together, hand-in-hand,  for the survival, well-being and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers.WHD is a campaign organized  by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).<br/><br/> This year NITSMUN takes pride   and the opportunity to raise awareness and show the importance, effectiveness and positive impact of humanitarian work.</>)

    Content:(<>“Don’t go near the temple”, “Don’t cook or touch anything in the kitchen” and similar others are some common phrases every Indian woman gets to hear during her “that time of the month” when she is often considered “unclean”. Even in 2022, menstruation is considered a taboo, not only in India but in fact all over the world. Still today, menstruation is a period that is a reason for discrimination and exclusion for millions of girls and women.<br/><br/> Fun fact, 28th Of May is celebrated as World Menstrual Hygiene Day as each menstrual cycle is of approximately 28 days and 5 days is the average period of menstruation. Fascinating right?<br/><br/> This day was initiated by a german-based NGO WASH UNITED under UNICEF in 2014 to break social stigmas, educate women, provide moral support, and develop more hygienic facilities in developing countries. Every year, UNICEF conducts campaigns, donates sanitary products, and intends to innovate, create awareness, and find solutions to the daily challenges faced by menstruators.<br/><br/> MHD’s theme this year is “To create a world where no women or girl is held back because they menstruate, by 2030” and it's all about breaking stigmas on menstruation all over the world. It aims to make that 15-year-old girl more confident about who she is, to make that 30-year-old working mother feel unashamed to share her feelings, to stop those people who think menstrual onset is a time to get her married, to stop those widening eyes when they hear “that” word, to make the word menstruation a normal rather than a secretive shame.<br/><br/> Today, NITSMUN stands holding hands with all the menstruators in the world, recalling that chapter which we studied back in eighth grade as an explanation of a normal phenomenon and wishes them a Happy World’s Menstrual Hygiene Day!</>)

IDB has an unique theme for each year and likewise the theme for the year 2022 is "BUILDING A SHARED FUTURE FOR ALL LIFE". This year's theme is decided after taking into consideration the aim of highlighting the importance of biodiversity for many sustainable development issues.<br/><br/> When we think about the lifestyle we are leading, the significance of this day comes into light as well. It is BIODIVERSITY that not only provides a home for many of the world's species, but also serves as a source of food, water, and other resources that we rely on to survive. Hence, understanding the value of biodiversity and acknowledging the problems associated with it is the need of the hour. Thus, this day is of utmost importance as well.<br/><br/> To sum up, on this International Biodiversity Day, NITSMUN urges everyone to celebrate the biodiversity our Mother Nature embraces and work each day for giving all species their right to thrive on this planet.</>)

    Content:(<>In today's world of power hungry countries going to war with each other, the message of World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development is more important than ever - the essential role of intercultural dialogue to achieve world peace and sustainable development. This is especially important in this present age of globalisation with interconnected global economies and cultural exchanges.<br/><br/> Keeping these things in mind, the United Nations General Assembly declared this international holiday in 2002 following UNESCO's adoption of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001 under UN Resolution 57/249. They recognise the need to “enhance the potential of culture as a means of achieving prosperity, sustainable development and global peaceful coexistence.”<br/><br/> Since then, this day has been celebrated all over the world to spread awareness about the need to bridge cultures for peace, stability and development. An interesting statistic to put this into perspective - over three fourths of world conflicts is due to lack of cultural harmony. The pandemic also proved the value and importance of the cultural and creative sector in generating social cohesion, educational resources and personal well-being in times of crisis. Cultural diversity contributes to both economic and personal development through exchange of ideas, intellectual values, emotions and morals, which makes it an indispensable part of sustainable development.<br/><br/> Therefore, NITSMUN calls for the people of this world to come together and spread the essence of cultural diversity and hence, indirectly work towards making this world a better place to live in.</>)

Starting from the era of telegrams, telephones, and televisions to a small rectangle-shaped device that contains the whole world, we’ve come a long way.<br/><br/> Since 1969, 17 may is marked as the day of the singing of the first International Telegraph Convention(ITC) and the creation of the International Telecommunication Union(ITU).
    The General Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/60/252) in March 2006 stipulating that World Information Society Day (WISTD) shall be celebrated every year on 17 May.<br/><br/> On this day, the world is brought together with new innovations and ideas to enhance communication around the globe. Various programs and meetings are arranged to discuss the ongoing issues and develop more connections and eradicate the digital divide, inequality between the countries. And this union aims towards highlighting and working on major issues like these to bring people together.<br/><br/> The past three years have brought many challenges including the need of accelerating digital transformation and retrieve information globally. The covid-19 pandemic taught us how to stay close to our loved ones even when they are far away.<br/><br/> Every year, the day is celebrated under a particular theme, and this year it is - Digital Technologies For Older Persons And Healthy Ageing. This year’s theme emphasizes the use of information technologies and their importance to stay healthy, connected, and independent on a physical, emotional, and financial level.<br/><br/> Today, NITSMUN recognizes this initiative taken by the United Nations and celebrates the internet and this feeling of being blessed by the technology around us as a whole and as a way of living.</>)

Homes destroyed, industries uprooted, cities deserted, the Second World War brought a wave of destruction which eventually ended with the surrender of Imperial Japan after nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br/><br/> On 8th May 1945, Nazi Germany officially surrendered unconditionally to the allied forces. Therefore, to commemorate all the victims of the Second World War, the UN General Assembly, by resolution 64/257, invited all member states to observe 8th and 9th May as a day to pay tribute to all the lives lost during the Second World War.<br/><br/> With the ongoing tensions in the world, it becomes more important for us to understand what destruction a massive conflict like this can bring to humanity. Therefore, NITSMUN today takes this chance to remember all the lives lost during the Second World War and promote the UN motto 'Peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet'.</>)

    Content:(<>World Press Freedom Day was declared by the UN General Assembly in December 1993, following the recommendation of the UNESCO General Conference. Since then, May 3, the anniversary of the Declaration of Windhoek has been celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom Day.<br/><br/> May 3 acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom and is also a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics.
    This year on 2-5 May 2022, UNESCO and the Republic of Uruguay will host the annual World Press Freedom Day Global Conference in a hybrid format in Punta Del Este, Uruguay. Under the theme “Journalism under Digital Siege”, the digital era’s impact on freedom of expression, the safety of journalists, access to information and privacy will be discussed.
    Journalists and media workers are increasingly facing physical and verbal abuse, threats and intimidation, lawsuits and imprisonment to silence them. Online sexual harassment of female journalists has increased exponentially. Anti-media rhetoric, repeatedly used by some politicians and government leaders, undermines freedom of speech and puts individual journalists at risk.<br/><br/> This year NITSMUN takes this chance and opportunity to raise awareness of the fact that for humanity’s well-being, accurate information is a public good and to fully honour the courage of journalists to inform the public, we must ensure that their rights are respected, protected and met.</>)

The theme for this year is 'Act together to build a positive safety and health culture'.<br/><br/> With the advent of new technologies and production processes, workers are more prone to emerging occupational risks. As per the UN, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong OSH (Occupational Safety and Health) system was seen, which included meaningful participation of governments, employers, workers and all relevant stakeholders which proved crucial in protecting work environments. We need to focus on building a positive OSH culture which can be achieved through inclusion and open communication between all relevant parties.<br/><br/> As we continue to live through a global health crisis and ongoing OSH risks in the world of work, we must continue to work towards building a strong safety and health culture at all levels.</>)

In the “General debate of September, 2018", World Leaders united and declared "International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace” to be marked each year on 24th April.<br/><br/> Multilateralism has its own essence. It embraces the philosophy of acceptance and international cooperation. It is also an essential commodity for the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development.<br/><br/> We are in a dreadful period where revolts occur capriciously. The dreads of Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine show us the essential need of truce through talks. The increasing vigour in nuclear and destructive weapons should also be monitored and controlled by the member states. NITSMUN alongside all the solicitous organisations urge the council of states to implement the promises signed on paper. As they say, one piece of paper is sharper than a sword.

    Content:(<>The original roots of designating a day for Mother earth goes back to the 1970s when environmental protection was not yet a priority of the national political agendas. The UN Conference on the Human Environment 1972 in Stockholm marked the beginning of global awareness of the interdependence among people, other living species and our planet, as well as the establishment of World Environment Day on 5 June and the UN Environment Programme.<br/><br/> In 1992, Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the Statement of principles for the Sustainable Management of Forests were adopted by over 178 Governments at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the first major conference in which Sustainable Development was the main issue discussed by member states. The General Assembly designated 22 April as International Mother Earth Day through a resolution adopted in April 2009.<br/><br/> Heat waves, cyclones and floods during the dry season- are some of the SOS calls we have come across but have failed to meet the expectation at an institutional level. The past world leaders were reluctant enough to not take any coordinated and well-executed action despite having plans of sustainability against man’s never-ending demand of extracting natural resources. Now, we are running out of time, and climate change is triggering an irreversible chain reaction causing extreme weather events across the globe. Moreover, the average global temperatures are expected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees which could further be increased if timely actions are not put in place.<br/><br/> Despite our advancements in technological and educational fields, we have been quite incapable of catering to Mother Earth which has provided us with all her natural resources. The NITSMUN fraternity requests you all to stop being ignorant and become vocal advocates of sustainable development, by spreading awareness about the same and by becoming the change you seek in society. TOGETHER WE CAN, TOGETHER WE WILL!</>)

Since the invention of Internet, the world has greatly shrunk and individuals are now linked 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As we attempt to fulfill every commitment of our life, we often forget to take care of ourselves in the midst of this battle. The stress levels continue to rise until a huge collapse occurs, causing us to realise that in all of our frantic activity, we have neglected to take care of one precious aspect of our lives: our health.<br/><br/> Every year on April 7, the World Health Organization (WHO) chooses a contemporary wellness or medical issue to promote. This day sets the platform for what's to come on the global stage, with topics ranging from mental health aspects to insurance and everything in between. It provides a global opportunity to focus attention on important public health issues that affect the international community.<br/><br/> It was first observed on 22th of July 1949, but the date was later changed to 7th of April, the establishment of WHO (World Health Organization). Since 1950, the Worth Health Day uses a different theme each year selected by the current WHO Director-General, based on the suggestions of the member governments and staff. On this occasion promotional programs are launched that continue for a long time after April 7.<br/><br/> On World Health Day 2022, WHO will focus global attention on urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a movement to create societies focused on well-being.<br/><br/> Good health is more than just the absence of disease; it is a reflection of a community's social and mental well-being. As a result, changes in a community should seek not only to reduce sickness, but also to reduce social tensions and mental ill-health to acceptable levels in order to meet the goal of providing health for everyone.<br/><br/> Thus NITSMUN urges everyone to aim for a healthy lifestyle and act on this year's theme to put a step closer towards everyone's health and well-being.</>)

    Eshan, the Vice President of External Affairs for VIT Vellore's Model United Nations Society might come across as a formidable delegate, but he is one of the most empathetic, and approachable people you’ll meet. An advocate for climate change action, Eshan has had the distinct fortune of interacting with several regional and foreign dignitaries, including Mr. Narendra Modi, and Mr. Vladimir Putin. An avid reader, Eshan's love for the law, polity, and statecraft can only be rivalled by the rich world of reading and literature. Eshan's extensive knowledge of global, & national politics allows him to engage in stimulating discussions on any socio-political issue under the sun. Presenting before you, the very charismatic @i_am_percyj as the Chairperson for the committee of UNHCR. Glad to have you with us!
