        The basic framework of a progressive society is based on freedom,
        equality and dignity. Democracy gives the citizens the right to question

        International Day of Democracy. The International Day of Democracy helps
        us acknowledge the importance of functional democracy and provides an
        opportunity to review the state of democracy worldwide.

        <br /> The International Day of Democracy helps us acknowledge the
        importance of functional democracy and provides an opportunity to review
        the state of democracy worldwide. The word ‘democracy’ comes from the
        Greek words ‘demos’ and ‘kratos’ which means ‘rule by the people' . The
        term ‘democracy’ describes a system where the citizens have the power to
        elect leaders to form the government. <br />
        <br /> Today marks the 15th anniversary of the International Day of
        Democracy, still, we observe that democracy is backsliding across the
        world. Therefore, NITSMUN calls on everyone to join hands to secure
        democracy for a prosperous world.{" "}

        <br /> The vicious nature of conflicts today is affecting the futures of
        entire generations of children. Without access to education, children
        living in conflict will grow up without the skills they need to
        contribute to their countries, amplifying the desperate situation of
        billions of children and their families.To recognize the importance of
        raising awareness on the dire need to preserve education and protect it
        from attack, the International Day to Protect Education from Attack is
        observed every year on September 9. <br />
        <br /> In an united decision of the UN General Assembly in May 2020 ,
        UNESCO and UNICEF were called upon to raise awareness of the sorrow of
        billions of children living in countries affected by war. The resolution
        proclaiming the Day was presented by the State of Qatar and was
        supported by 62 countries.
        <br />
        <br /> The General Assembly resolution states that countries have the
        primary responsibility to provide protection and ensure inclusive and
        equitable quality education at all levels to all learners (in the
        3-18years age group), especially those in vulnerable situations.
        <br />
        <br /> This year NITSMUN takes pride and the opportunity to raise
        awareness and show the importance, effectiveness and impact of providing
        access to quality educational opportunities for all in times of crisis.

        Terrorism today has become the systematic weapon of a war that knows no

        ideologies continue to harm, maim and kill thousands of innocent people

        unheard, their rights being forgotten, their needs remaining unattended
        and their values lost forever.
        <br />
        <br /> Most of the victims of terrorism are innocent civilians, in the
        wrong place at the wrong time, targeted by brutal and indiscriminate
        attacks. The lives of survivors of the attacks and the families of the
        victims are irreparably damaged. It takes many survivors years, and some
        never recover from these traumatic memories.
        <br />
        <br /> For this reason, the United Nations General Assembly established
        the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of
        Terrorism to be commemorated annually on 21 August since 2017, in order
        to fully honour and support the victims and survivors of terrorism and
        to promote and protect the full enjoyment of their human rights and
        fundamental freedoms.
        <br />
        <br /> We cannot have a war on terrorism when war itself is terrorism.
        This year, NITSMUN urges everyone to remember and honour the victims of
        terrorism and celebrate this day as an opportunity to promote peaceful
        coexistence between different cultures and civilizations.

        Our planet is suffering from multiple crises: Violent conflicts; some
        years-long, intensifying droughts; extreme weather and epidemics as
        climate change ; pandemics like COVID-19. More people than ever before
        need humanitarian assistance.
        <br />
        <br /> There is a saying that goes: It takes a village to raise a child.
        Similarly, it takes many people to support a person in a humanitarian
        crisis. With the world reaching the zenith of humanitarian needs, this
        year’s World Humanitarian Day (WHD) builds on this metaphor of
        collective endeavor to grow global appreciation of humanitarian work.
        <br />
        <br /> On 19 August 2003, a bomb attack in Baghdad, Iraq, killed 22
        humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the
        Secretary-General for Iraq. Five years after that terrible mishap, the
        United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 19
        August as World Humanitarian Day (WHD).
        <br />
        <br /> Far from any spotlight , some God-like souls come together to
        ease suffering and bring optimism.The 2022 WHD campaign pays a heed to
        the thousands of volunteers and professionals who deliver urgent health
        care, shelter, food, protection, water and much more.
        <br />
        <br /> Each year, WHD brings together countries from across the
        humanitarian system to stand together, hand-in-hand, for the survival,
        well-being and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety
        and security of aid workers.WHD is a campaign organized by the United
        Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
        <br />
        <br /> This year NITSMUN takes pride and the opportunity to raise
        awareness and show the importance, effectiveness and positive impact of
        humanitarian work.

        menstruation is a period that is a reason for discrimination and
        exclusion for millions of girls and women.
        <br />
        <br /> Fun fact, 28th Of May is celebrated as World Menstrual Hygiene
        Day as each menstrual cycle is of approximately 28 days and 5 days is
        the average period of menstruation. Fascinating right?
        <br />
        <br /> This day was initiated by a german-based NGO WASH UNITED under
        UNICEF in 2014 to break social stigmas, educate women, provide moral
        support, and develop more hygienic facilities in developing countries.
        Every year, UNICEF conducts campaigns, donates sanitary products, and
        intends to innovate, create awareness, and find solutions to the daily
        challenges faced by menstruators.
        <br />
        <br /> MHD’s theme this year is “To create a world where no women or
        girl is held back because they menstruate, by 2030” and it's all about
        breaking stigmas on menstruation all over the world. It aims to make
        that 15-year-old girl more confident about who she is, to make that
        30-year-old working mother feel unashamed to share her feelings, to stop
        those people who think menstrual onset is a time to get her married, to
        stop those widening eyes when they hear “that” word, to make the word
        menstruation a normal rather than a secretive shame.
        <br />
        <br /> Today, NITSMUN stands holding hands with all the menstruators in
        the world, recalling that chapter which we studied back in eighth grade
        as an explanation of a normal phenomenon and wishes them a Happy World’s
        Menstrual Hygiene Day!

        the theme for the year 2022 is "BUILDING A SHARED FUTURE FOR ALL LIFE".
        This year's theme is decided after taking into consideration the aim of
        highlighting the importance of biodiversity for many sustainable
        development issues.
        <br />
        <br /> When we think about the lifestyle we are leading, the
        significance of this day comes into light as well. It is BIODIVERSITY
        that not only provides a home for many of the world's species, but also
        serves as a source of food, water, and other resources that we rely on
        to survive. Hence, understanding the value of biodiversity and
        acknowledging the problems associated with it is the need of the hour.
        Thus, this day is of utmost importance as well.
        <br />
        <br /> To sum up, on this International Biodiversity Day, NITSMUN urges
        everyone to celebrate the biodiversity our Mother Nature embraces and
        work each day for giving all species their right to thrive on this
        planet.

        intercultural dialogue to achieve world peace and sustainable
        development. This is especially important in this present age of
        globalisation with interconnected global economies and cultural
        exchanges.
        <br />
        <br /> Keeping these things in mind, the United Nations General Assembly
        declared this international holiday in 2002 following UNESCO's adoption
        of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001 under UN
        Resolution 57/249. They recognise the need to “enhance the potential of
        culture as a means of achieving prosperity, sustainable development and
        global peaceful coexistence.”
        <br />
        <br /> Since then, this day has been celebrated all over the world to
        spread awareness about the need to bridge cultures for peace, stability
        and development. An interesting statistic to put this into perspective -
        over three fourths of world conflicts is due to lack of cultural
        harmony. The pandemic also proved the value and importance of the
        cultural and creative sector in generating social cohesion, educational
        resources and personal well-being in times of crisis. Cultural diversity
        contributes to both economic and personal development through exchange
        of ideas, intellectual values, emotions and morals, which makes it an
        indispensable part of sustainable development.
        <br />
        <br /> Therefore, NITSMUN calls for the people of this world to come
        together and spread the essence of cultural diversity and hence,
        indirectly work towards making this world a better place to live in.

        without the internet. Starting from the era of telegrams, telephones,
        and televisions to a small rectangle-shaped device that contains the
        whole world, we’ve come a long way.
        <br />
        <br /> Since 1969, 17 may is marked as the day of the singing of the
        first International Telegraph Convention(ITC) and the creation of the
        International Telecommunication Union(ITU). The General Assembly adopted
        a resolution (A/RES/60/252) in March 2006 stipulating that World
        Information Society Day (WISTD) shall be celebrated every year on 17
        May.
        <br />
        <br /> On this day, the world is brought together with new innovations
        and ideas to enhance communication around the globe. Various programs
        and meetings are arranged to discuss the ongoing issues and develop more
        connections and eradicate the digital divide, inequality between the
        countries. And this union aims towards highlighting and working on major
        issues like these to bring people together.
        <br />
        <br /> The past three years have brought many challenges including the
        need of accelerating digital transformation and retrieve information
        globally. The covid-19 pandemic taught us how to stay close to our loved
        ones even when they are far away.
        <br />
        <br /> Every year, the day is celebrated under a particular theme, and
        this year it is - Digital Technologies For Older Persons And Healthy
        Ageing. This year’s theme emphasizes the use of information technologies
        and their importance to stay healthy, connected, and independent on a
        physical, emotional, and financial level.
        <br />
        <br /> Today, NITSMUN recognizes this initiative taken by the United
        Nations and celebrates the internet and this feeling of being blessed by
        the technology around us as a whole and as a way of living.

        The Second World War started when Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler
        decided to attack Poland, in 1939. It has been the worst conflict in
        human history killing at least 40 to 50 million people. The Second World
        War resulted in the death of 5.8 million people from Poland, which was
        20% of Poland's pre-war population. Homes destroyed, industries
        uprooted, cities deserted, the Second World War brought a wave of

        after nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

        after nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
        <br />
        <br /> On 8th May 1945, Nazi Germany officially surrendered
        unconditionally to the allied forces. Therefore, to commemorate all the
        victims of the Second World War, the UN General Assembly, by resolution
        64/257, invited all member states to observe 8th and 9th May as a day to
        pay tribute to all the lives lost during the Second World War.
        <br />
        <br /> With the ongoing tensions in the world, it becomes more important
        for us to understand what destruction a massive conflict like this can
        bring to humanity. Therefore, NITSMUN today takes this chance to
        remember all the lives lost during the Second World War and promote the
        UN motto 'Peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet'.

        World Press Freedom Day was declared by the UN General Assembly in

        Conference. Since then, May 3, the anniversary of the Declaration of
        Windhoek has been celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom Day.
        <br />
        <br /> May 3 acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect
        their commitment to press freedom and is also a day of reflection among
        media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional
        ethics. This year on 2-5 May 2022, UNESCO and the Republic of Uruguay
        will host the annual World Press Freedom Day Global Conference in a
        hybrid format in Punta Del Este, Uruguay. Under the theme “Journalism
        under Digital Siege”, the digital era’s impact on freedom of expression,
        the safety of journalists, access to information and privacy will be
        discussed. Journalists and media workers are increasingly facing
        physical and verbal abuse, threats and intimidation, lawsuits and
        imprisonment to silence them. Online sexual harassment of female
        journalists has increased exponentially. Anti-media rhetoric, repeatedly
        used by some politicians and government leaders, undermines freedom of
        speech and puts individual journalists at risk.
        <br />
        <br /> This year NITSMUN takes this chance and opportunity to raise
        awareness of the fact that for humanity’s well-being, accurate
        information is a public good and to fully honour the courage of
        journalists to inform the public, we must ensure that their rights are
        respected, protected and met.

        <br />
        <br /> With the advent of new technologies and production processes,
        workers are more prone to emerging occupational risks. As per the UN,
        during the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong OSH (Occupational Safety and
        Health) system was seen, which included meaningful participation of
        governments, employers, workers and all relevant stakeholders which
        proved crucial in protecting work environments. We need to focus on
        building a positive OSH culture which can be achieved through inclusion
        and open communication between all relevant parties.
        <br />
        <br /> As we continue to live through a global health crisis and ongoing
        OSH risks in the world of work, we must continue to work towards
        building a strong safety and health culture at all levels.

        <br />
        <br /> Multilateralism has its own essence. It embraces the philosophy
        of acceptance and international cooperation. It is also an essential
        commodity for the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development.
        <br />
        <br /> We are in a dreadful period where revolts occur capriciously. The
        dreads of Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine show us the
        essential need of truce through talks. The increasing vigour in nuclear
        and destructive weapons should also be monitored and controlled by the
        member states. NITSMUN alongside all the solicitous organisations urge
        the council of states to implement the promises signed on paper. As they
        say, one piece of paper is sharper than a sword. And one action of
        accord is powerful than an army!

        well as the establishment of World Environment Day on 5 June and the UN
        Environment Programme.
        <br />
        <br /> In 1992, Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on Environment and
        Development, and the Statement of principles for the Sustainable
        Management of Forests were adopted by over 178 Governments at the Rio de
        Janeiro Earth Summit, the first major conference in which Sustainable
        Development was the main issue discussed by member states. The General
        Assembly designated 22 April as International Mother Earth Day through a
        resolution adopted in April 2009.
        <br />
        <br /> Heat waves, cyclones and floods during the dry season- are some
        of the SOS calls we have come across but have failed to meet the
        expectation at an institutional level. The past world leaders were
        reluctant enough to not take any coordinated and well-executed action
        despite having plans of sustainability against man’s never-ending demand
        of extracting natural resources. Now, we are running out of time, and
        climate change is triggering an irreversible chain reaction causing
        extreme weather events across the globe. Moreover, the average global
        temperatures are expected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees which could
        further be increased if timely actions are not put in place.
        <br />
        <br /> Despite our advancements in technological and educational fields,
        we have been quite incapable of catering to Mother Earth which has
        provided us with all her natural resources. The NITSMUN fraternity
        requests you all to stop being ignorant and become vocal advocates of
        sustainable development, by spreading awareness about the same and by
        becoming the change you seek in society. TOGETHER WE CAN, TOGETHER WE
        WILL!

        lives: our health.
        <br />
        <br /> Every year on April 7, the World Health Organization (WHO)
        chooses a contemporary wellness or medical issue to promote. This day
        sets the platform for what's to come on the global stage, with topics
        ranging from mental health aspects to insurance and everything in
        between. It provides a global opportunity to focus attention on
        important public health issues that affect the international community.
        <br />
        <br /> It was first observed on 22th of July 1949, but the date was
        later changed to 7th of April, the establishment of WHO (World Health
        Organization). Since 1950, the Worth Health Day uses a different theme
        each year selected by the current WHO Director-General, based on the
        suggestions of the member governments and staff. On this occasion
        promotional programs are launched that continue for a long time after
        April 7.
        <br />
        <br /> On World Health Day 2022, WHO will focus global attention on
        urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a
        movement to create societies focused on well-being.
        <br />
        <br /> Good health is more than just the absence of disease; it is a
        reflection of a community's social and mental well-being. As a result,
        changes in a community should seek not only to reduce sickness, but also
        to reduce social tensions and mental ill-health to acceptable levels in
        order to meet the goal of providing health for everyone.
        <br />
        <br /> Thus NITSMUN urges everyone to aim for a healthy lifestyle and
        act on this year's theme to put a step closer towards everyone's health
        and well-being.
